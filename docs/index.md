title: Julia bindings for ECharts 3

---

## Overview

The [ECharts.jl](https://github.com/randyzwitch/ECharts.jl) package provides a Julia wrapper around the [ECharts 3 JavaScript library](http://echarts.baidu.com/download.html) from [Baidu](http://www.baidu.com/).

In particular, ECharts.jl provides:

* A series of Julia composite types representing ECharts visualization primitives
* High-level functions for quickly creating visualizations such as bar charts, area charts, line charts and others
* Support for ColorBrewer color scales via the [ColorBrewer.jl](https://github.com/timothyrenner/ColorBrewer.jl) package and other fun themes via the [NoveltyColors.jl](https://github.com/randyzwitch/NoveltyColors.jl) package, for visually stunning color schemes
